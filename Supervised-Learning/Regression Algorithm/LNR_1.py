Algorithm 1: linear regression
keypoint:
 1. use to understand relationship between variables
 2. relationship between independent variable X and dependent variable Y
 3. goal is to find an optimal linear function, that is, to determine a set of coefficients (weights) so that the function can predict the value of the dependent variable as accurately as possible.
